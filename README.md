***Python order of code evaluation & building program examples - General***

Variables → Functions → Loops → Booleans - Conditionals → Collections (Lists, Dictionaries) → Classes

Use: Quick reference guide for remembering the how/what of a particular object/tool in Python

Why: When learning something new, it is necessary to build and maintain a foundational knowledge of the subject

How: Utilizing the resource available to me (zybooks and Visual Studio Code(VSC) I translated confusing sentences and built formats for informations that I could easily
understand, then with the assistance of ChatGPT and Deepseek (1min.ai) I was able to streamline the storage of this information.

Please make sure to remember the order of evaluation.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
***Troubleshooting masterdoc to assist in resolving bad code - Troubleshooting Master doc***
(All other troubleshooting docs are in the troubleshooting off-shoot branch)
    
      1. TypeError
      2. ValueError
      3. ZeroDivisionError
      4. IndexError
      5. KeyError

Use: The purpose of this project is to assist me in learning Python. I shared it because I believe it may have utility for other beginners.

Why: After formatting and reformatting the structure of both these generalized documents, I have finally created a standard of understanding for myself centered around what I believe to be core topics from which I can understand the languge of Python.

How: I will not take credit for anything beyond the structure and stylistic formatting of the code you see in the troubleshooting document (I wrote the first few lines and nothing more) I used https://app.1min.ai/code-generator to develop this tool and fed it an outline I made of what I wanted, then a series of prompts around what I envisioned the structure of the code to look like.

Note: It should be easy to read for and understand for a casual Python coder given that I am a near total beginner in Python and can easily understand how this tool is meant to work.

Remember: Reading is fundamental

Accessing the document from this page:
    
      1. Scroll up and select the green 'Code' button
      2. Select 'Code Spaces'
      3. Select the plus (+) symbol
      4. On the left drop down menu select 'TroubleshootingMaster'

If you do not see a play button on the top right corner follow these instructions:
      
      5. Wait 5-10 seconds
      6. In the bottom right hand corner you may be asked to install a program
      7. Select the blue 'install' button to install the Python debugger browser extension
      (You will now be able to access these documents from your browser)


Utilizing the Troubleshooting doc (this assumes you have access to some type of code interpreter e.g. VSC)
     
      1. Read the last line of the error block that appears in your working terminal to determine the error type you have
      2. The Python debugger browsing add on is necessary to have installed when using this document (which you should know since you read the instructions)
      3. Press the play button in the top right corner and select 'Python Debugger: Python File'
      4. Run the program (refer to point 1.)
      5. After inputting the issue you have in the terminal...
                 * Verify the issue is similar to what you have on your screen
                 * CTRL+F, type the error you have, and scroll to read the suggested resolutions.
      6. Implement the solution.
      7. If the issue is beyond the scope of the troubleshooting document...
                 * Go to the troubleshooting_offshoot branch for more detailed assistance
                 * Build a new troubleshooting guide around your particular issue
