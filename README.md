This troubleshooting offshoot branch was created as a response to the fact that the master_doc could not cover the entire database of errors from python.

Using the format from the Python Error Troubleshooting Guide, create a new version that focuses on syntax-related errors only. 
Include examples and explanations for IndentationError, SyntaxError, TabError, UnboundLocalError, ModuleNotFoundError, and ImportError. 
Follow the same structure with a try/except example and a corrected version: (Copy and paste the troubleshooting master doc into the GPT)

The only gpts capable of doing this (as of 06/18/2025) are:
GPT 4, GPT-4o mini, and reasoning.
